okay guys here im trying to remember how to use vim, okay
I remember what I do. 
Press I to insert text
Press ESC to go to commands 
H J K L to move within a text
0 to go to the beggining of the line
$ to go to the end of the line
Okay, so another commands are
:w to save (write a file)
:wq to save and quit 
:q to quit
:q! to quit without any savings
